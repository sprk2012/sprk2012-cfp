# Humans at The Core of Ruby

The Ruby community is composed of two parts, Ruby itself
and people. Although we love coding Ruby, not having the
right approach when it comes to people, including ourselves,
will block us from ever achieving happiness in any programming
endeavor.

First, what is it that Ruby has that makes us feel happier when
programming? How can we leverage Ruby to better express
ourselves?

Second, our clients have their own realities, each one with
their own tastes and ways of looking at the world. How can we
leverage Ruby to connect their realities with ours using an
ubiquitous language and achieve success in our projects?

To improve our community and have more fun than ever, we have
to improve on the most important aspect of any software project:
the people. I'll talk about that.
