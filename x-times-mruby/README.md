# x-times mruby

The source code of mruby was just released a month ago. Despite the fact
that there is still a long way to got for this new implementation, it
already proofs to be useful by being slim and still powerful.

I want to introduce a new approach of customizing a Ruby Interpreter for
a specific task. Having such a strip-down Ruby implementation could make
it feasable to approach i.e. parallelism in an Erlang way. Or open even
more areas to Ruby.

Let's see how many mruby's we can code.

- footprint and limitation
- use-cases

Daniel Bovensiepen is currently living in China where he is building
signaling systems for metros (subways) all over the world. Everyone
is telling him that he can not use Ruby in these environments but he
still insist on proving them wrong by showing how to integrate-
non-safe technologies like Ruby into safety-critical environments without
risks.

Since the release of mruby he made several contributions like an
embeddable version of the irb and a new test system for the mruby
implementation which can easily run directly on embedded devices.

With the rising of mruby his dream of making embedded programming
as easy as web programming might come true in the long-run.
