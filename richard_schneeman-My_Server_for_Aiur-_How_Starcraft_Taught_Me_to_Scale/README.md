# My Server for Aiur: How Starcraft Taught Me To Scale

Starcraft is a game of making the right decisions at the right time and so is web development. Premature optimization and abstraction can kill a business faster than not being able to scale. In this talk we'll take a look at how to pick the right unit composition (databases vs. NoSQL), balance your macro and micro (scale out vs. up), and choose the right race (programing language). If you've never played Starcraft, and can't tell a ultralisk from a firebat, don't worry there's still a room for you.
