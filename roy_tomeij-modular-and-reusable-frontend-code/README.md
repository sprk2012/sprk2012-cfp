# Modular & reusable front-end code with HTML5, Sass and CoffeeScript

A lot of Ruby developers use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.

Keeping your front-end code clean is hard. Before you know it you're suffering from CSS specificity issues and not-really-generic partials. Find out how to keep things tidy using the HTML5 document outline and modular Sass & CoffeeScript, for truly reusable code.

## Notes for reviewer

Based on my experience in front-end in general and Haml, Sass/Compass and CoffeeScript in specific I'd like to share how to create truly modular and reusable front-end code for projects of any size.

Things to cover: how does the HTML5 document outline help with creating reusable chunks of code, how to structure your HTML and Sass in a way that enables reusing "modules" and how to bind JavaScript events without tying your JS too closely to your HTML and CSS. I'll touch on the asset pipeline too.

I have given this talk at [wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com/) in Wroclaw, Poland and [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/) in Reston, VA,USA in March. Later this year I'll be giving this presentation at [Euruko](http://euruko2012.org/), [Ruby Lugdunum](http://rulu.eu/), [ArrrrCamp](http://arrrrcamp/be/) and a conference in the Ukraine. Here's the [video from Wroc_love.rb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-75HdADc8) (30 minute version).

You'll find some attendee responses in [this Storify](http://storify.com/roy/some-tweets-about-my-wrocloverb-talk). It may be interesting to read the comments to [my Euruko pull request](https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals/pull/6) too, with comments from organizers, attendees, well-known speakers and a Compass core member.
