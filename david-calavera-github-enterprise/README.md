# Scaling in the unknown, how GitHub develops, ships and supports GitHub Enterprise.

My talk description

Everybody talks about scaling up, but, what happens when you have to scale
down? or even, what happens when you don't control where your product is
being deployed? In this session we'll talk about how we build GitHub
enterprise, keeping every feature that you can find in github.com, and how
we ship it ready to deploy on your infrastructure.

- Preferred presentation day: no preference
