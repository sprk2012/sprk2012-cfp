# ZeroMQ: scriptable sockets

ZeroMQ is a socket abstraction and concurrency framework that's changing the way we think and reason about distributed systems. Mailboxes, atomic message delivery and swappable transports allow for fast, flexible and resilient network topologies. It's I/O model also sits very well with all Ruby implementations. In this talk we'll discuss :

- What's wrong with socket I/O ?
- Supported messaging patterns
- Transport agnostic messaging
- Resiliency
- Building out topologies just in time (interjection principle)
- Performance and throughput
- Mongrel2 Ruby adapter
- How to use it from Ruby
- Small case study
