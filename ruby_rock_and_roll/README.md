# Ruby, Rock and Roll

[Muse](http://github.com/sausheong/muse) is a Ruby domain-specific language for creating digital music. In this presentation, I will talk on how Ruby can be used to create digital music through a simple analog software synthesizer, either transcribed from existing music scores, or algorithmically created out of data from various sources. 

The assets in this folder are examples of the output of Muse, as well as a transcription of Muse for Alla Turca (Mozart) and Hotel California (the Eagles). The produced files are in WAV format but to keep the file size down, the music files have been compressed to MP3.
