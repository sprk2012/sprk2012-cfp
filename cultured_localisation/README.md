# Cultured localisation, or 'how not to offend 1 billion people'

This talk isn’t really about localisation or internationalisation (add a
‘z’ if you prefer!) – it’s about culture and understanding. It’s about
how we should all be approaching localisation challenges as people
problems and to give good examples of how to get it right and where you
can go so very wrong.

Your framework and tool of choice is the easy part – understanding the
people you’re wanting to each out to is oh-so-very hard and too often
seen as only just a translation problem – a simple matter of swapping
one string for another.

I’ll talk about how people communicate across cultures, even when they
are so different. Drawing on my experience as a teacher of english as a
foreign language and my own travels and struggles to absorb another
people’s language and culture, I hope I’ll change how you think about
solving these problems in future.

Hell, I’ll even make you laugh. I hope. The most important thing
though, I’ll provoke a discussion, given the diverse multilingual
background of the attendees here; it could be a very good one.

## Ryan Stenhouse

Ryan's a Ruby fanatic with a love of languages, programming and
otherwise. He's well travelled and has worked on projects of varying
complexity for companies you've probably heard of. He’s also a little
bit nuts when it comes to communication and has a burning passion for
getting groups of people together to solve their problems. He also
really hates describing himself in the third person and has only
recently gotten over his aversion to tofu.

## Past talks
