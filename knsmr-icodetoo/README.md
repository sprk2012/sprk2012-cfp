# Title of the talk: We code. I code, too.

Being an online tech journalist doesn't mean he or she codes. I do. Once having been a hobby programmer as a kid, I rekindled my passion for programming a couple years ago. Learning Ruby with a side project([Worklista.com](http://worklista.com)) has been such a joy. Also, I did it to try something new for my job. I wanted to make a difference in how we do online media business. I firmly believe that doing next media business requires technological differentiation. Creating a new platform requires basic understandings of how things are built and run. Ruby seemed to be the shortest path to me.

Teaming up with brilliant Rails developers that I met through a local Rubyist community, we launched a new service project named [QA@IT](http://qa.atmarkit.co.jp) in last May. It is basically a Japanese version of StackOverflow.com. Although I thought I knew what features we would need, the whole project turned out to be a bumpy road. It was no hayride both implementation-wise and project management-wise.

In this talk, I would like to share my experience and insights as a lay Ruby/Rails coder who has lead a Rails project like the way a small startup would do. Faced with a bunch of conflicts and difficulties within the ten-year old media company I am working for, I have gradually come to a realization that building a great product at a 'traditional company' takes more than technology and a process.
