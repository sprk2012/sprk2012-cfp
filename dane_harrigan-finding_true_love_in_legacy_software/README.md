# Finding True Love in Legacy Software

Every line of code has a story. Every block of code has a lesson. The
Heroku API is the oldest and largest codebase on the platform. This is
my story of being introduced to the code and why I've fallen for it.

In this presentation I'll go through code that, at face value, may seem
strange or wrong, but offers much more when you place yourself in the
shoes of the developer at that time.

Legacy software may come with code you'd rather not see or touch, but it
also comes with solutions to problems you don't have to relive and a
history of why certain decisions were made.

I'll talk about how and why inheriting legacy code can be a great
experience.
