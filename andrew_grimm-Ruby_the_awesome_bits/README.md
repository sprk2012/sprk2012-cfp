# Ruby: the awesome parts

According to Stack Overflow, Ruby on Rails is a more popular programming language than Ruby, with 73 thousand versus 46 thousand questions. As a Plain Old Ruby Object specialist, let me show you some parts of Ruby that are often missed by introductory Ruby books, and overlooked by time-pressed Rails developers. I will show you how to be more assertive with Hash#fetch rather than Hash#[], how to use a more functional programming style, how to delegate more, and what ["1", "2", "3"].map(&method(:Integer)) does.

- Preferred presentation day: no preference
- Presentation language: English, hopefully with Japanese subtitles.

Andrew Grimm is a bioinformatician at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. He came across Ruby while using Rails at his previous job associated with the Encyclopedia of Life, but now specialises in Plain Old Ruby Objects.

He has worked on various projects outside of work. One analyzed why you always end up at "Philosophy" in Wikipedia. Another was a fork of Heckle in which zombies eat your brains unless your unit tests can kill them all. At RubyKaigi 2011 he demonstrated the Small Eigen Collider, which generates random Ruby code that can be run under different implementations of Ruby to check for inconsistencies or bugs.
