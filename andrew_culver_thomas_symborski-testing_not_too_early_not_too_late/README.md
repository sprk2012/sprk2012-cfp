# Testing: Not Too Early, Not Too Late
# タイトル (title in Japanese; optional)

It seems many of the most vocal advocates of test-driven development (TDD) teach an absolute approach. However, over-testing and premature testing do exist, and both present their own set of risks. Let there be no mistake: It's not wether you test. It's when. Automated testing is an essential skill for any developer. However, recognizing when tests provide true value is a skill many developers have acquired over time.

We're seeking to provide a balanced view of the general consensus within the Rails community about when to test. No software project fits in a standard mold, so why have an absolute standard approach? The better developers can learn to adapt their approach to fit the need, the more they'll increase their ability to be successful. In grand scheme of things, tests are only a part of the larger software development process. As such, they should be utilized to help the developer, not make his/her lives more difficult or stifle productivity or creativity. 

After a fearful session of joint confession, we realized we've come to a lot of the same conclusions independently of one another. Neither one wanting to tread this dangerous terrain alone, so we've decided to team up in this attempt at a balanced discussion of our experiences keeping code clean and keeping clients happy.
