# The Front End Revolution: Hacking CSS

Ruby and Rails made it fun to develop web applications, but making those applications beautiful has been an agonizing process. We've too long accepted the pain that CSS causes us. Fortunately, we're starting to see projects that make implementing design easy. In my talk, I'll cover these trends, and touch on some technologies we can use.

Here's a rough outline of my talk:

* Why hackers should care about CSS
* Refactoring CSS with SASS
* Open sourcing design with Bootstrap
* Advanced CSS techniques (responsive design, css selectors, etc.)

## My bio (required)

I first came to Tokyo in 2006 and found a job as a software developer at a Japanese startup. In 2009, I left to co-found [Mobalean](http://www.mobalean.com), where Iâ€™m bootstrapping our event management startup, [Doorkeeper](http://www.doorkeeperhq.com).

After RubyKaigi 2010, I founded [Tokyo Rubyist Meetup](http://www.tokyorubyistmeetup.org) in response to a demand for more collaboration between international and Japanese Rubyists.
