# Load testing done real

## Abstract

Imagine this:

```
Hey Joe, do you think we should make our app faster?
No Bill, I think it's fine as it is, people can wait a little it's not a big deal.
```

Everyone who has had that conversation with their co-workers can leave the room. For the rest of you, I'm going to present some interesting ways to turn the tedious and boring work of load testing into something a lot more fun and with much better results in the end. Let's go!

## Details

In this talk I will give you a quick tour through existing load testing approaches and then give you some food for though on how to:

* use scientific methods of Artifical Intelligence to create realistic load scenarios
* build a distributed infrastructure to run your tests in a way normal traffic would hit your system
* analyze the results and find bottlenecks in your system

## Bio

I am Thorben, former founder of “kopfmaschine”, a German Rails shop located in Bremen and now working at Engine Yard in San Francisco to make the cloud a better place for developers. I am living and breathing Ruby since my days at University where I graduated with my thesis on how to scale large Rails applications which is the scientific foundation of this talk.

## Meta

The talk can be between 25 and 45 minutes. The talk is suited for any audience with at least intermediate understanding of software engineering processes.
